Poche -- a translation tool. The phrases you actually need, right in your pocket.

Are you interested in learning a new language, but existing platforms aren't teaching you the phrases you want to learn? Are you traveling for some niche interest and need to know how to say a bunch of weirdly specific things? This app allows you to search for any word or phrase and then save the translation to your account. Your translated words and phrases are easily searchable, browseable, and perhaps in the fullness of time, taggable.
